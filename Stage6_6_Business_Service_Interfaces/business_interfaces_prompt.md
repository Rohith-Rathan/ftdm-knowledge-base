# Phase 6: Business Service Interfaces

## 🎯 **Phase Objective**
Design comprehensive business service interfaces based on FSD requirements, ensuring 100% business functionality coverage with auto-testing and input validation.

## 📋 **AUTO-TESTING & INPUT VALIDATION**

### **Pre-Phase Validation Checklist**
- [ ] FSD document is complete and validated
- [ ] All business functionalities are identified
- [ ] Domain logic requirements are clear
- [ ] Business rules are specified
- [ ] Service boundaries are defined

### **Input Completeness Checker**
```bash
# Run auto-testing script
./scripts/validate-phase6-inputs.sh
```

**Required Inputs:**
1. **FSD Document** - Complete functional specification
2. **Business Requirements** - All business functionalities
3. **Domain Logic** - Business logic requirements
4. **Business Rules** - Domain-specific rules
5. **Service Boundaries** - Service scope definitions

### **Missing Input Detection**
If any input is incomplete, the system will:
- **Identify specific gaps** in business requirements
- **Generate resource request** for missing information
- **Block phase progression** until 100% complete
- **Provide clear guidance** on what's needed

## 🏗️ **Business Service Interfaces Process**

### **Step 1: Service Identification**
- Extract all business services from FSD
- Identify service boundaries and responsibilities
- Map service dependencies
- Validate service completeness

### **Step 2: Interface Design**
- Design service interfaces
- Define method signatures
- Create service contracts
- Validate interface completeness

### **Step 3: Domain Logic Mapping**
- Map business logic to services
- Define domain-specific operations
- Create business rule interfaces
- Validate logic completeness

### **Step 4: Service Contracts**
- Create service contracts
- Define input/output models
- Specify error handling
- Validate contract completeness

## 📊 **Output Requirements**

### **Service Interfaces**
- Complete C# interface definitions
- Method signatures and contracts
- Input/output models
- Error handling specifications

### **Service Contracts**
- Service boundary definitions
- Business logic contracts
- Domain operation specifications
- Error handling contracts

### **Validation Report**
- Service interface completeness verification
- Business logic coverage validation
- Contract validation
- Coverage assessment

## 🔍 **Quality Gates**

### **Completeness Validation**
- [ ] 100% business functionalities covered
- [ ] All services have interfaces
- [ ] Business logic is mapped
- [ ] Service contracts are defined

### **Quality Standards**
- [ ] Interfaces follow C# conventions
- [ ] Service boundaries are clear
- [ ] Business logic is properly abstracted
- [ ] Contracts are comprehensive

## 🚨 **Error Handling**

### **Input Validation Errors**
- **Missing FSD**: Request complete FSD document
- **Incomplete Business Logic**: Request missing business requirements
- **Missing Service Boundaries**: Request service scope definitions
- **Incomplete Contracts**: Request service contract specifications

### **Output Validation Errors**
- **Interface Gaps**: Identify missing service interfaces
- **Logic Issues**: Fix business logic mapping
- **Contract Issues**: Fix service contracts
- **Validation Failures**: Fix interface validation rules

## 📈 **Success Criteria**

### **Phase Completion Requirements**
- [ ] All business services have interfaces
