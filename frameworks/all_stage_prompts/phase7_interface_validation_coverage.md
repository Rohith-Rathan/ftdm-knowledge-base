# Phase 7: Interface Validation & Coverage

## 🎯 **Phase Objective**
Validate comprehensive coverage of business service interfaces against FSD requirements, ensuring 100% business functionality coverage with auto-testing and input validation.

## 📋 **AUTO-TESTING & INPUT VALIDATION**

### **Pre-Phase Validation Checklist**
- [ ] Business service interfaces are complete
- [ ] FSD document is complete and validated
- [ ] All business functionalities are identified
- [ ] Service contracts are defined
- [ ] Business logic is mapped

### **Input Completeness Checker**
```bash
# Run auto-testing script
./scripts/validate-phase7-inputs.sh
```

**Required Inputs:**
1. **Service Interfaces** - Complete C# interface definitions
2. **FSD Document** - Complete functional specification
3. **Business Requirements** - All business functionalities
4. **Service Contracts** - Service boundary definitions
5. **Business Logic** - Domain-specific logic requirements

### **Missing Input Detection**
If any input is incomplete, the system will:
- **Identify specific gaps** in interface coverage
- **Generate resource request** for missing information
- **Block phase progression** until 100% complete
- **Provide clear guidance** on what's needed

## 🏗️ **Interface Validation & Coverage Process**

### **Step 1: Coverage Analysis**
- Analyze FSD against service interfaces
- Identify missing business functionalities
- Map coverage gaps
- Validate completeness

### **Step 2: Interface Validation**
- Validate interface completeness
- Check method signatures
- Verify input/output models
- Validate error handling

### **Step 3: Business Logic Validation**
- Validate business logic coverage
- Check domain operations
- Verify business rules
- Validate service boundaries

### **Step 4: Coverage Report**
- Generate coverage report
- Identify gaps and issues
- Provide recommendations
- Validate 100% coverage

## 📊 **Output Requirements**

### **Coverage Analysis Report**
- Complete coverage analysis
- Gap identification
- Coverage percentages
- Recommendations

### **Validation Report**
- Interface validation results
- Business logic validation
- Contract validation
- Error handling validation

### **Gap Analysis**
- Missing functionalities
