# ðŸ”„ INTERACTIVE REQUIREMENT REFINEMENT FRAMEWORK

## **OVERVIEW**
This framework implements the proven ChatGPT approach for requirement refinement before EFTDM execution. It ensures requirements are crystal clear before generating documentation.

## **PHASE 0: INTERACTIVE REQUIREMENT REFINEMENT**

### **Step 1: Initial Requirement Analysis**
```
You are a Senior Product Developer with 10+ years of experience. I need you to analyze my raw requirements and help me refine them into a clear, actionable specification.

**My Raw Requirements:**
[USER_PROVIDES_RAW_REQUIREMENTS]

**Your Task:**
1. Analyze the requirements for completeness and clarity
2. Identify missing information, ambiguities, or gaps
3. Ask clarifying questions to refine the requirements
4. Suggest improvements for better understanding
5. Help me iterate until we have crystal-clear requirements

**Analysis Questions I Should Ask:**
- What is the primary goal of this application?
- Who are the target users?
- What are the core features vs nice-to-have features?
- What are the business rules and constraints?
- What is the expected user flow?
- What are the technical requirements?
- What are the success criteria?

**Refinement Process:**
1. I provide raw requirements
2. You analyze and ask clarifying questions
3. I answer and refine requirements
4. We iterate until requirements are crystal clear
5. You confirm requirements are ready for EFTDM
```

### **Step 2: Mermaid Diagram Generation**
```
Now that we have clear requirements, let's create visual flow diagrams to validate our understanding.

**Available Diagram Types:**
1. **User Journey Flow** - Complete user experience from start to finish
2. **System Architecture Flow** - Technical system interactions
3. **Business Process Flow** - Business logic and decision points
4. **Data Flow Diagram** - How data moves through the system
5. **Decision Tree Flow** - Conditional logic and branching
6. **Gantt Chart** - Project timeline and dependencies

**Which approach would you like to proceed with?**
- **Option A**: Start with User Journey Flow (recommended for most applications)
- **Option B**: Start with System Architecture Flow (for technical applications)
- **Option C**: Start with Business Process Flow (for business applications)
- **Option D**: Create multiple diagrams in sequence
- **Option E**: Let me suggest the best approach based on your requirements

**Interactive Refinement Process:**
1. You choose the diagram approach
2. I generate the initial diagram
3. You review and provide feedback
4. I refine the diagram based on your feedback
5. We iterate until the diagram accurately represents your vision
6. We move to the next diagram type if needed
```

### **Step 3: Requirement Validation**
```
Let's validate our refined requirements against the generated diagrams:

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Requirements match the user journey flow
- [ ] Business rules are correctly represented
- [ ] Technical constraints are addressed
- [ ] User experience is logical and complete
- [ ] System architecture supports all features
- [ ] Data flow is efficient and secure
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable

**Final Confirmation:**
Are you satisfied with:
1. The clarity of requirements?
2. The accuracy of flow diagrams?
3. The completeness of the specification?

If yes, we're ready to proceed to EFTDM Phase 1.
If no, let's identify what needs refinement.
