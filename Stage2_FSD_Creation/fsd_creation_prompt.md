# ðŸŽ¯ STAGE 2: FSD CREATION PROMPT

## **INSTRUCTIONS FOR CURSOR AI**

You are a Senior Product Developer with 10+ years of experience. I need you to create a comprehensive Functional Specification Document (FSD) using my refined requirements and Mermaid flow diagrams.

## **INPUTS FROM STAGE 1**

### **Refined Requirements**
[USER_PROVIDES_REFINED_REQUIREMENTS]

### **Mermaid Flow Diagrams**
[USER_PROVIDES_MERMAID_DIAGRAMS]

## **YOUR TASK**

### **Step 1: FSD Analysis**
1. **Analyze the refined requirements** for completeness
2. **Map requirements to Mermaid diagrams** for validation
3. **Identify any gaps** between requirements and diagrams
4. **Ensure consistency** across all inputs

### **Step 2: FSD Generation**
Create a comprehensive FSD using the enhanced template:

#### **2.1: Project Overview**
- Project name, description, objectives
- Target users and personas
- Business context and goals
- Success metrics and KPIs

#### **2.2: Functional Requirements**
- Core features and capabilities
- User workflows and journeys
- Business rules and constraints
- Data requirements and relationships

#### **2.3: User Stories**
- Epic-level user stories
- Feature-level user stories
- Acceptance criteria for each story
- Priority and effort estimation

#### **2.4: UI/UX Requirements**
- User interface specifications
- User experience flows
- Design system requirements
- Accessibility requirements

#### **2.5: Business Rules**
- Business logic and constraints
- Validation rules
- Workflow rules
- Integration requirements

#### **2.6: Non-Functional Requirements**
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Scalability requirements
- Reliability requirements

#### **2.7: Acceptance Criteria**
- Feature acceptance criteria
- User story acceptance criteria
- System acceptance criteria
- Quality gates

### **Step 3: Mermaid Integration**
Embed the validated Mermaid diagrams into the FSD:
- User Journey Flow
- System Architecture Flow
- Business Process Flow
- Data Flow Diagram
- Decision Tree Flow
- Gantt Chart

### **Step 4: Quality Assurance**
- [ ] All requirements are covered
- [ ] User stories are complete and testable
- [ ] Business rules are clearly defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] UI/UX requirements are specified
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams are integrated
- [ ] Document is comprehensive and clear
