- Domain-specific calculations and business logic
- Industry-standard workflows and processes
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Data requirements and relationships

#### **2.3: User Stories**
- Epic-level user stories
- Feature-level user stories
- Acceptance criteria for each story
- Priority and effort estimation

#### **2.4: UI/UX Requirements**
- User interface specifications
- User experience flows
