# ðŸŽ¯ STAGE 2: FSD CREATION PROMPT

## **INSTRUCTIONS FOR CURSOR AI**

You are a Senior Product Developer with 10+ years of experience. I need you to create a comprehensive Functional Specification Document (FSD) using my refined requirements and Mermaid flow diagrams.

## **INPUTS FROM STAGE 1**

### **Refined Requirements**
[USER_PROVIDES_REFINED_REQUIREMENTS]

### **Mermaid Flow Diagrams**
[USER_PROVIDES_MERMAID_DIAGRAMS]

## **YOUR TASK**

### **Step 1: Domain Intelligence Integration**

#### **1.1: Domain Context Analysis**
1. **Domain Detection**: Identify and validate the primary domain from Stage 1
2. **AI-Agentic Detection**: Identify AI-agentic patterns (conversational AI, AI automation, AI-assisted, multi-agent)
3. **Industry Research**: Research industry standards, best practices, and regulatory requirements
4. **AI Service Research**: Research AI service integrations and AI-agentic patterns
5. **Compliance Mapping**: Map relevant compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, AI ethics)
6. **Domain-Specific Patterns**: Identify domain-specific workflows, calculations, and business rules
7. **AI-Agentic Patterns**: Identify AI-agentic workflows, conversation patterns, and automation requirements

#### **1.2: Industry Standard Analysis**
1. **Best Practices Research**: Research industry-specific best practices and methodologies
2. **Common Workflows**: Identify common workflows and processes in the domain
3. **Regulatory Requirements**: Map regulatory requirements and compliance standards
4. **Technology Standards**: Identify industry-standard technology stacks and frameworks

#### **1.3: Business Context Integration**
1. **Business Goals Alignment**: Ensure FSD aligns with business objectives and success metrics
2. **User Persona Validation**: Validate user personas against domain-specific requirements
3. **Workflow Optimization**: Optimize workflows based on industry best practices
4. **Success Criteria Refinement**: Refine success criteria based on domain standards

### **Step 2: Enhanced FSD Analysis**
1. **Analyze the refined requirements** for completeness and domain appropriateness
2. **Map requirements to Mermaid diagrams** for validation and consistency
3. **Identify domain-specific gaps** between requirements and industry standards
4. **Ensure domain compliance** across all inputs and requirements

### **Step 3: Domain-Intelligent FSD Generation**
Create a comprehensive FSD using the enhanced template with domain intelligence:

#### **3.1: Project Overview**
- Project name, description, objectives
- Target users and personas (domain-specific)
- Business context and goals (industry-aligned)
- Success metrics and KPIs (domain-appropriate)
- Domain-specific compliance requirements

#### **3.2: Functional Requirements**
- Core features and capabilities (domain-specific)
- User workflows and journeys (industry-standard)
- Business rules and constraints (domain-appropriate)
- Domain-specific calculations and business logic
- Industry-standard workflows and processes
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Data requirements and relationships

#### **2.3: User Stories**
- Epic-level user stories
- Feature-level user stories
- Acceptance criteria for each story
- Priority and effort estimation

#### **2.4: UI/UX Requirements**
- User interface specifications
- User experience flows
- Design system requirements
- Accessibility requirements

#### **2.5: Business Rules**
- Business logic and constraints
- Validation rules
- Workflow rules
- Integration requirements

#### **2.6: Non-Functional Requirements**
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Scalability requirements
- Reliability requirements

#### **2.7: Acceptance Criteria**
- Feature acceptance criteria
- User story acceptance criteria
- System acceptance criteria
- Quality gates

### **Step 3: Mermaid Integration**
Embed the validated Mermaid diagrams into the FSD:
- User Journey Flow
- System Architecture Flow
- Business Process Flow
- Data Flow Diagram
- Decision Tree Flow
- Gantt Chart

### **Step 4: Quality Assurance**
- [ ] All requirements are covered
- [ ] User stories are complete and testable
- [ ] Business rules are clearly defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] UI/UX requirements are specified
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams are integrated
- [ ] Document is comprehensive and clear

## **FSD TEMPLATE STRUCTURE**

```markdown
# FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT (FSD)

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
### 1.1 Project Information
### 1.2 Objectives
### 1.3 Target Users
### 1.4 Success Metrics

## 2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
### 2.1 Core Features
### 2.2 User Workflows
### 2.3 Business Rules
### 2.4 Data Requirements

## 3. USER STORIES
### 3.1 Epic Stories
### 3.2 Feature Stories
### 3.3 Acceptance Criteria

## 4. UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
### 4.1 User Interface
### 4.2 User Experience
### 4.3 Design System
### 4.4 Accessibility

## 5. BUSINESS RULES
### 5.1 Business Logic
### 5.2 Validation Rules
### 5.3 Workflow Rules
### 5.4 Integration Rules

## 6. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
### 6.1 Performance
### 6.2 Security
### 6.3 Scalability
### 6.4 Reliability

## 7. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
### 7.1 Feature Criteria
### 7.2 User Story Criteria
### 7.3 System Criteria
### 7.4 Quality Gates

## 8. MERMAID DIAGRAMS
### 8.1 User Journey Flow
### 8.2 System Architecture Flow
### 8.3 Business Process Flow
### 8.4 Data Flow Diagram
### 8.5 Decision Tree Flow
### 8.6 Gantt Chart

## 9. APPENDICES
### 9.1 Glossary
### 9.2 References
### 9.3 Assumptions
### 9.4 Risks
```

## **EXPECTED OUTPUT**

### **File Naming Convention**
**CRITICAL**: Save the FSD document with project-specific naming:
- **File Name**: `{PROJECT_NAME}_fsd.md`
- **Location**: `Stage2_FSD_Creation/{PROJECT_NAME}_fsd.md`
- **Example**: If project is "TaskManager", save as `TaskManager_fsd.md`

After completion, you will have:
- âœ… **Comprehensive FSD** covering all requirements
- âœ… **Complete user stories** with acceptance criteria
- âœ… **Clear business rules** and constraints
- âœ… **Detailed UI/UX requirements**
- âœ… **Integrated Mermaid diagrams**
- âœ… **Ready for Stage 3** (TSD Creation)

## **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Review the generated FSD** for completeness
2. **Provide feedback** on any missing or unclear sections
3. **Confirm accuracy** of all requirements
4. **Approve the FSD** for Stage 3
5. **Proceed to Stage 3** with validated FSD
