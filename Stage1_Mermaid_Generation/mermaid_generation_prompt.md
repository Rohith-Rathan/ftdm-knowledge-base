```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Step 1]
    B --> C[Step 2]
    C --> D[Decision Point]
    D -->|Yes| E[Path A]
    D -->|No| F[Path B]
    E --> G[End]
    F --> G
```

#### **2.2: System Architecture Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Microservice 1]
    B --> D[Microservice 2]
    C --> E[Database 1]
    D --> F[Database 2]
    G[External Service] --> B
```

#### **2.3: Business Process Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Business Event] --> B[Process Step 1]
    B --> C[Decision Point]
    C -->|Condition 1| D[Process A]
    C -->|Condition 2| E[Process B]
    D --> F[End State]
    E --> F
```

#### **2.4: Data Flow Diagram**
```mermaid

    B -->|Yes| C[Action A]
    B -->|No| D{Condition 2?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Action B]
    D -->|No| F[Action C]
```

#### **2.6: Gantt Chart**
```mermaid

    Testing          :2024-04-01, 14d
    Deployment       :2024-04-15, 7d
```

### **Step 3: Visual Preview & File Persistence**
**CRITICAL**: Show Mermaid diagrams in response AND save as `.mmd` files:

1. **Display each diagram** in the response using Mermaid syntax for visual preview
2. **Save each diagram** as a separate `.mmd` file in the `Stage1_Mermaid_Generation/diagrams/` directory
3. **Create the diagrams directory** if it doesn't exist
4. **Verify file creation** by listing the generated files
5. **Provide file paths** for each generated diagram

### **Step 4: Figma Analysis (If UXD Provided)**
**CRITICAL**: If UXD folder with Figma links is provided:

1. **Analyze Figma links** from `UXD/figma_links.md` file
2. **Run comprehensive Figma analysis** using the framework script
3. **Download assets** (icons, images, components) from Figma screens
4. **Generate CSS variables** from design system analysis
5. **Create asset inventory** with file paths and usage contexts
6. **Provide asset usage guide** for Vue.js implementation

**Figma Analysis Commands:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive Figma analysis
./scripts/comprehensive-figma-analysis.sh

# This will:
# - Analyze all Figma screens
# - Download assets to figma_assets/screens/
# - Generate CSS variables
# - Create asset inventory
# - Generate usage guide
```

**Required Files to Generate:**
- `user_journey.mmd`
- `system_architecture.mmd` 
- `business_process.mmd`
- `data_flow.mmd`
- `decision_tree.mmd`
- `gantt_chart.mmd`

### **Step 4: Interactive Refinement**
1. **Present each diagram** for your review
2. **Ask for feedback** on accuracy and completeness
3. **Refine diagrams** based on your feedback
4. **Update saved files** with refinements
5. **Iterate until perfect** representation of your vision
