4. **Iterative Refinement**: Help iterate until we have crystal-clear requirements

### **Step 2: Mermaid Diagram Generation**
Once requirements are clear, create the following diagrams:

#### **2.1: User Journey Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Step 1]
    B --> C[Step 2]
    C --> D[Decision Point]
    D -->|Yes| E[Path A]
    D -->|No| F[Path B]
    E --> G[End]
    F --> G
```

#### **2.2: System Architecture Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Microservice 1]
    B --> D[Microservice 2]
    C --> E[Database 1]
    D --> F[Database 2]
    G[External Service] --> B
```

#### **2.3: Business Process Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Business Event] --> B[Process Step 1]
    B --> C[Decision Point]
    C -->|Condition 1| D[Process A]
    C -->|Condition 2| E[Process B]
    D --> F[End State]
    E --> F
```

#### **2.4: Data Flow Diagram**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Source] --> B[Data Processing]
    B --> C[Data Validation]
    C --> D[Data Storage]
    D --> E[Data Retrieval]
    E --> F[Data Presentation]
```

#### **2.5: Decision Tree Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root Decision] --> B{Condition 1?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action A]
    B -->|No| D{Condition 2?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Action B]
    D -->|No| F[Action C]
```

#### **2.6: Gantt Chart**
```mermaid
gantt
    title Project Timeline
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Phase 1
    Project Setup    :a1, 2024-01-01, 7d
    Authentication   :after a1, 14d
    section Phase 2
    File Upload      :2024-01-22, 21d
    AI Processing    :2024-02-12, 28d
    section Phase 3
    Data Review      :2024-03-11, 14d
    Submission       :2024-03-25, 7d
    section Phase 4
    Testing          :2024-04-01, 14d
    Deployment       :2024-04-15, 7d
```

### **Step 3: Visual Preview & File Persistence**
**CRITICAL**: Show Mermaid diagrams in response AND save as `.mmd` files:

1. **Display each diagram** in the response using Mermaid syntax for visual preview
2. **Save each diagram** as a separate `.mmd` file in the `Stage1_Mermaid_Generation/diagrams/` directory
3. **Create the diagrams directory** if it doesn't exist
4. **Verify file creation** by listing the generated files
5. **Provide file paths** for each generated diagram

### **Step 4: Figma Analysis (If UXD Provided)**
**CRITICAL**: If UXD folder with Figma links is provided:

1. **Analyze Figma links** from `UXD/figma_links.md` file
2. **Run comprehensive Figma analysis** using the framework script
3. **Download assets** (icons, images, components) from Figma screens
4. **Generate CSS variables** from design system analysis
5. **Create asset inventory** with file paths and usage contexts
6. **Provide asset usage guide** for Vue.js implementation

**Figma Analysis Commands:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive Figma analysis
./scripts/comprehensive-figma-analysis.sh

# This will:
# - Analyze all Figma screens
# - Download assets to figma_assets/screens/
# - Generate CSS variables
# - Create asset inventory
# - Generate usage guide
```

**Required Files to Generate:**
- `user_journey.mmd`
- `system_architecture.mmd` 
- `business_process.mmd`
- `data_flow.mmd`
- `decision_tree.mmd`
- `gantt_chart.mmd`

### **Step 4: Interactive Refinement**
1. **Present each diagram** for your review
2. **Ask for feedback** on accuracy and completeness
3. **Refine diagrams** based on your feedback
4. **Update saved files** with refinements
5. **Iterate until perfect** representation of your vision

### **Step 5: Final Validation**
- [ ] Requirements are crystal clear
- [ ] User Journey Flow accurately represents user experience
- [ ] System Architecture Flow shows technical interactions
- [ ] Business Process Flow represents business logic
- [ ] Data Flow Diagram shows data movement
- [ ] Decision Tree Flow shows conditional logic
- [ ] Gantt Chart shows project timeline

## **CLARIFYING QUESTIONS I SHOULD ASK**

### **Target Users**
- Who are your primary users?
- What age group and technical skill level?
- What are their main goals and pain points?

### **Core Features**
- What are the must-have features vs nice-to-have?
- What are the core user workflows?
- What are the business rules and constraints?

### **Technical Requirements**
- What platforms do you need? (Web, Mobile, Desktop)
- What are your performance requirements?
- What integrations do you need?

### **Business Context**
- What is your business model?
- What are your success metrics?
- What is your timeline and budget?

### **Success Criteria**
- How will you measure success?
- What are your key performance indicators?
- What are your acceptance criteria?

## **EXPECTED OUTPUT**

After refinement, you will have:
- âœ… **Crystal clear requirements** with no ambiguities
- âœ… **Complete set of Mermaid diagrams** representing your vision
- âœ… **Visual validation** of your understanding
- âœ… **Ready for Stage 2** (FSD Creation)
