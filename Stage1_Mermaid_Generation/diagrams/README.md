# Stage 1: Mermaid Generation - Diagrams Folder

## 📁 Purpose
This folder will contain the generated Mermaid diagrams and images **only after** Stage 1 is executed with user requirements.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Empty by Default**: This folder starts empty - no sample files
2. **User Input**: User provides raw requirements + 3 clarifying questions
3. **AI Generation**: Stage 1 analyzes requirements and generates 6 custom diagrams
4. **File Creation**: Both MMD and PNG files are created dynamically
5. **User Verification**: User reviews generated diagrams and can request refinements

## 📋 Generated Files (After Stage 1 Execution)
- `user_journey.mmd` - User journey flow diagram
- `system_architecture.mmd` - System architecture diagram  
- `business_process.mmd` - Business process flow diagram
- `data_flow.mmd` - Data flow diagram
- `decision_tree.mmd` - Decision tree diagram
- `gantt_chart.mmd` - Project timeline Gantt chart
- `analysis_results.json` - Requirements analysis results
- `current_requirements.txt` - Processed requirements
- `generation_report.md` - Generation summary report
- `images/` folder containing 6 PNG files

## 🔄 Iterative Refinement
- User can modify requirements and regenerate diagrams
- Old files are backed up before creating new ones
- Supports both requirement changes and specific diagram modifications

## ⚠️ Important
**Do not add sample files here manually.** All files should be generated by the Stage 1 system based on actual user requirements.

## 🎯 Next Steps
Run Stage 1 with your requirements to generate custom diagrams for your project.
