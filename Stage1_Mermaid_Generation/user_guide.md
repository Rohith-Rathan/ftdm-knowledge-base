**Success Criteria**: 1000 users in 6 months, $10K monthly revenue
```

### **Generated Diagrams:**
- **User Journey Flow**: Complete buyer experience from app download to product review
- **System Architecture Flow**: Mobile app â†’ API Gateway â†’ Microservices â†’ Databases
- **Business Process Flow**: Seller listing â†’ Admin approval â†’ Buyer purchase â†’ Commission calculation
- **Data Flow Diagram**: User data â†’ Authentication â†’ Product data â†’ Order data â†’ Payment data
- **Decision Tree Flow**: User type â†’ Feature access â†’ Business rules â†’ Actions
- **Gantt Chart**: 3-month development timeline with phases and milestones

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- [ ] Requirements are crystal clear
- [ ] All flow diagrams accurately represent your vision
- [ ] No ambiguities or missing flows
- [ ] Ready for FSD creation

## **NEXT STAGE**
Once validated, proceed to **Stage 2: FSD Creation** with your refined requirements and Mermaid diagrams.

## **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Vague Requirements**: AI will ask clarifying questions - answer them thoroughly
2. **Missing Flows**: Review diagrams and identify what's missing
3. **Incorrect Logic**: Provide specific feedback on what needs to change
4. **Too Complex**: Break down complex requirements into simpler parts

### **Tips for Success:**
1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed requirements rather than high-level ideas
2. **Answer Questions**: Respond to all clarifying questions from AI
3. **Review Carefully**: Take time to review each diagram thoroughly
4. **Iterate**: Don't hesitate to ask for refinements until perfect
