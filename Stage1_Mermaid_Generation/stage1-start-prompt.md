## **üéØ What Happens Next**

After you send this prompt, I will:

1. **Analyze Your Requirements** - Extract key information and patterns
2. **Ask 3 Critical Questions**:
   - **Domain & AI-Agentic**: What's your primary domain? Does it need AI features?
   - **Business Context**: What's your primary business goal? Who are your target users?
   - **Technical Stack**: Use default stack (.NET Core 8.0 + Vue.js 3 + MongoDB + Azure) or specify your preferences?

3. **Generate 6 Mermaid Diagrams** with visual previews:
   - User Journey Flow
   - System Architecture Flow
   - Business Process Flow
   - Data Flow Diagram
   - Decision Tree Flow
   - Gantt Chart

4. **Create Files Automatically**:
   - 6 MMD files
   - 6 PNG image files
   - Analysis results
   - Generation report

5. **Provide Refinement Options** - You can modify requirements and regenerate diagrams

## **‚úÖ Benefits of This Approach**

- ‚úÖ **Direct Start**: No file setup required
- ‚úÖ **Immediate Analysis**: I analyze your requirements right away
- ‚úÖ **Visual Previews**: See diagrams in the response
- ‚úÖ **File Generation**: Automatic MMD and PNG creation
- ‚úÖ **Iterative Refinement**: Easy to make changes and regenerate

## **üîÑ Alternative: File-Based Approach**

If you prefer the file-based approach (from the website instructions):

1. Create `raw-requirement.md` with your requirements
2. Update `mermaid_generation_prompt.md` with the file path
3. Use: `Hi, take the prompt from @mermaid_generation_prompt.md`

But the direct prompt approach above is simpler and faster!
