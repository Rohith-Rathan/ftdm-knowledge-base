# üéØ STAGE 1: TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## **COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS**

### **ISSUE 1: VAGUE REQUIREMENTS**

**Symptoms:**
- AI asks too many clarifying questions
- Generated diagrams are generic
- Missing specific details

**Solutions:**
1. **Be More Specific**: Instead of "user management", specify "user registration, login, profile update, password reset"
2. **Provide Context**: Explain the business purpose and user goals
3. **Give Examples**: Provide specific use cases and scenarios
4. **Define Terms**: Explain any business-specific terminology

**Example Fix:**
```
‚ùå Bad: "Users can manage their accounts"
‚úÖ Good: "Users can register with email/password, update profile information, change password, and delete account with confirmation"
```

### **ISSUE 2: MISSING BUSINESS RULES**

**Symptoms:**
- Diagrams don't show decision points
- Business logic is unclear
- Process flows are incomplete

**Solutions:**
1. **List All Rules**: Document all business constraints and rules
2. **Define Conditions**: Specify when different actions occur
3. **Include Exceptions**: Document error cases and edge cases
4. **Add Validations**: Specify data validation requirements

**Example Fix:**
```
‚ùå Bad: "Users can book appointments"
‚úÖ Good: "Users can book appointments if they are registered, the time slot is available, and they haven't exceeded the monthly limit of 5 appointments"
```

### **ISSUE 3: INCOMPLETE USER FLOWS**

**Symptoms:**
- User journey is too simple
- Missing error handling
- No alternative paths

**Solutions:**
1. **Map Complete Journey**: Include all steps from start to finish
2. **Add Error Paths**: Show what happens when things go wrong
3. **Include Alternatives**: Show different ways users can achieve goals
4. **Add Edge Cases**: Consider unusual or exceptional scenarios

**Example Fix:**
```
‚ùå Bad: "User logs in ‚Üí Views dashboard"
‚úÖ Good: "User logs in ‚Üí If login fails, show error ‚Üí If successful, view dashboard ‚Üí If no data, show empty state ‚Üí If error loading, show retry option"
```

### **ISSUE 4: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE ISSUES**

**Symptoms:**
- Missing system components
- Unclear data flow
- No security considerations

**Solutions:**
1. **List All Components**: Include all systems, services, and databases
2. **Show Data Flow**: Clearly indicate how data moves between components
3. **Include Security**: Add authentication, authorization, and data protection
4. **Consider Scalability**: Include load balancers, caching, and scaling considerations

**Example Fix:**
```
‚ùå Bad: "App connects to database"
‚úÖ Good: "Mobile app ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Authentication Service ‚Üí Business Logic Service ‚Üí Database (with encryption) ‚Üí External Payment API"
```

### **ISSUE 5: INCONSISTENT DIAGRAMS**

**Symptoms:**
- Diagrams contradict each other
- Different terminology used
- Misaligned processes

**Solutions:**
1. **Use Consistent Terms**: Use the same terminology across all diagrams
2. **Cross-Reference**: Ensure diagrams align with each other
3. **Validate Logic**: Check that business rules are consistent
4. **Review Together**: Review all diagrams as a set

**Example Fix:**
```
‚ùå Bad: User Journey says "Add to Cart", System Architecture says "Shopping Basket"
‚úÖ Good: Use "Add to Cart" consistently in all diagrams
```

## **STEP-BY-STEP TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Step 1: Identify the Issue**
- Which diagram has the problem?
- What specific aspect is unclear or incorrect?
- Is it a requirement issue or diagram issue?

### **Step 2: Analyze the Root Cause**
- Are requirements too vague?
- Are business rules missing?
- Is the diagram incomplete?
- Are there consistency issues?

### **Step 3: Apply the Solution**
- Use the appropriate solution from above
- Provide more specific information
- Add missing details
- Fix inconsistencies

### **Step 4: Validate the Fix**
- Check if the issue is resolved
- Ensure all diagrams are consistent
- Verify business logic is correct
- Confirm technical feasibility

## **PREVENTION TIPS**

### **Before Starting:**
1. **Gather All Information**: Collect all requirements, business rules, and constraints
2. **Define Terminology**: Create a glossary of business terms
3. **Identify Stakeholders**: Know who to ask for clarification
4. **Set Expectations**: Understand what level of detail is needed

### **During the Process:**
1. **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification
2. **Provide Examples**: Give specific examples of what you want
3. **Review Incrementally**: Check each diagram as it's created
4. **Validate Continuously**: Ensure consistency throughout

### **After Completion:**
1. **Review All Diagrams**: Check them as a complete set
2. **Get Stakeholder Feedback**: Share with business and technical teams
3. **Address Issues**: Fix any problems before proceeding
4. **Document Decisions**: Record any assumptions or decisions made

## **ESCALATION PROCESS**

### **When to Escalate:**
- Requirements are fundamentally unclear
- Business rules are contradictory
- Technical constraints are unrealistic
- Stakeholders disagree on requirements

### **How to Escalate:**
1. **Document the Issue**: Clearly describe the problem
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why it's blocking progress
3. **Suggest Solutions**: Offer possible ways to resolve it
4. **Request Decision**: Ask for guidance on how to proceed

### **Who to Escalate To:**
- **Business Issues**: Product Manager, Business Analyst
- **Technical Issues**: Technical Lead, Architect
- **Process Issues**: Project Manager, Scrum Master
- **Stakeholder Issues**: Project Sponsor, Executive
