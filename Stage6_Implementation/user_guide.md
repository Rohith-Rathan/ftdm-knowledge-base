# ðŸŽ¯ STAGE 5: IMPLEMENTATION - USER GUIDE

## **OVERVIEW**
This stage executes the complete EFTDM methodology using all validated documents from previous stages. This is where the actual development happens.

## **WHAT YOU GET**
- Complete Application Codebase
- Frontend Implementation
- Backend Implementation
- Database Setup
- Testing Suite
- Documentation

## **HOW TO USE**

### **Step 1: Copy the Prompt**
Copy the content from `implementation_prompt.md` to Cursor AI

### **Step 2: Provide Inputs**
Replace placeholders with:
- `[USER_PROVIDES_FSD_DOCUMENT]` - Your FSD from Stage 2
- `[USER_PROVIDES_MERMAID_DIAGRAMS]` - Your Mermaid diagrams from Stage 1
- `[USER_PROVIDES_TSD_DOCUMENT]` - Your TSD from Stage 3
- `[USER_PROVIDES_RTSD_DOCUMENT]` - Your RTSD from Stage 4 (Optional)
- `[USER_PROVIDES_UXD_ASSETS]` - Your UXD assets (Optional)

### **Step 3: Execute 7 Phases**
The AI will execute the Enhanced Fast-Track Development Methodology through 7 phases:

1. **Phase 1**: FSD Analysis & Validation
2. **Phase 2**: Implementation Planning
3. **Phase 3**: Project Setup & Architecture
4. **Phase 4**: Backend Implementation
5. **Phase 5**: Frontend Implementation
6. **Phase 6**: Integration & Testing
7. **Phase 7**: Deployment & Optimization

### **Step 4: Human-in-the-Loop**
- AI will ask for your confirmation before proceeding to each phase
- You can approve, modify, or request changes
- Type "PROCEED" to continue to next phase
- You control the quality and accuracy at each step

### **Step 5: Final Validation**
- Confirm all FSD requirements are implemented
- Verify technical architecture is followed
- Check UI/UX requirements are met
- Ensure all tests pass
- Confirm application is deployed

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- [ ] All FSD requirements are implemented
- [ ] Technical architecture is followed
- [ ] UI/UX requirements are met
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Application is deployed
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## **PHASES DETAILED**

### **Phase 1: FSD Analysis & Validation**
- Analyze FSD requirements for completeness
- Validate against Mermaid diagrams for consistency
- Identify implementation priorities and dependencies
- Create implementation roadmap

### **Phase 2: Implementation Planning**

- Configure development environment and tools
- Set up database and initial schema
- Configure CI/CD pipeline and deployment

### **Phase 4: Backend Implementation**
- Implement API endpoints based on TSD
- Create database models and relationships
- Implement business logic and validation
- Add authentication and security features

### **Phase 5: Frontend Implementation**
- Implement UI components based on RTSD
- Create user interfaces following design system
- Implement user workflows and interactions
- Add responsive design and accessibility

### **Phase 6: Integration & Testing**
- Integrate frontend and backend components
- Implement comprehensive testing suite
- Validate all requirements and acceptance criteria
- Perform quality assurance and bug fixes

### **Phase 7: Deployment & Optimization**
