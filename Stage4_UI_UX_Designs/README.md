# ðŸŽ¨ STAGE 4: UI/UX DESIGNS

## **OVERVIEW**

Stage 4 bridges the gap between technical specifications (TSD) and refined implementation (RTSD) by creating a comprehensive UI/UX design structure that ensures pixel-perfect implementation and design system consistency.

## **PURPOSE**

This stage transforms technical requirements into actionable UI/UX specifications by:
- Creating organized design asset structure
- Analyzing provided images and Figma links
- Generating design system and component library
- Establishing design consistency standards
- Preparing assets for development implementation

## **INPUTS**

### **Required:**
- **FSD Document** (from Stage 2)
- **TSD Document** (from Stage 3)

### **Optional (Choose One or More):**
- **Screen Images** (PNG/JPG files)
- **Figma Links** (URLs to Figma designs)
- **Design System Files** (JSON files)
- **Existing UI App** (Lovable, Replit, Figma Make, etc.)

## **OUTPUTS**

### **UXD Folder Structure:**
```
UXD/
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/                        # Screen images folder
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ navigation_list.md          # Screen navigation structure
â”œâ”€â”€ figma_screen_links.md           # Figma links with navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ design_system_files/            # Design system JSON files
â””â”€â”€ figma_captured_assets/          # Downloaded assets
    â”œâ”€â”€ icons/                      # All unique icons
    â”œâ”€â”€ images/                     # All unique images
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/                 # All unique components
    â”œâ”€â”€ css_variables.css           # Generated CSS variables
    â”œâ”€â”€ asset_inventory.json        # Asset inventory
    â”œâ”€â”€ screen_asset_mapping.json   # Background relationships
    â””â”€â”€ USAGE_GUIDE.md              # Usage guide
```

### **Generated Files:**
- **Navigation List** - Screen names and structure
- **Figma Links** - Organized Figma URLs with placeholders
- **Design System** - CSS variables and component library
- **Asset Mapping** - Background page-to-asset relationships
- **Usage Guides** - Implementation documentation

## **PROCESS**

### **Step 1: Create UXD Structure**
1. Create organized folder structure
2. Generate navigation list from FSD/TSD
3. Create Figma links template with placeholders

### **Step 2: Handle Three Scenarios**
1. **Having Designs** - Analyze provided images/links
2. **No Designs** - Create placeholder structure
3. **Existing UI** - Integrate existing app folder

### **Step 3: Hybrid Analysis**
1. **AI Vision Analysis** - Extract design system from images
2. **Figma MCP Integration** - Get precise measurements from links
3. **Design System Analysis** - Parse JSON files for tokens
4. **Manual Validation** - Ensure 100% accuracy

### **Step 4: Generate Design System**
1. Create CSS variables from design tokens
2. Generate Vue component library
3. Establish design consistency rules
4. Create implementation guides

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

The UI/UX Designs stage is successful when:
- âœ… UXD folder structure is complete and organized
- âœ… Navigation list matches FSD requirements
- âœ… Figma links are properly organized
- âœ… Design system is generated (if files provided)
- âœ… Assets are downloaded and mapped to screens
- âœ… Component library is created
- âœ… Usage guides are comprehensive
- âœ… Ready for Stage 5 (RTSD Creation)

## **NEXT STAGE**

After completing Stage 4, proceed to **Stage 5: RTSD Creation** which will use the UXD folder to create refined technical specifications.

**This stage ensures your application will have pixel-perfect UI implementation with consistent design system compliance.**
