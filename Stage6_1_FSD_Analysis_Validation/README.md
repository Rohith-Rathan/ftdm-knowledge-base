# ðŸŽ¯ STAGE 6.1: FSD ANALYSIS & VALIDATION

## **OVERVIEW**

Stage 6.1 focuses on comprehensive analysis and validation of the Functional Specification Document (FSD) to ensure all requirements are complete, consistent, and ready for implementation.

## **PURPOSE**

This stage validates the FSD document by:
- Analyzing functional requirements completeness
- Validating user stories and acceptance criteria
- Ensuring business logic coverage
- Identifying gaps and inconsistencies
- Preparing validated requirements for implementation planning

## **INPUTS**

### **Required:**
- **FSD Document** (from Stage 2)
- **Mermaid Diagrams** (from Stage 1)

### **Optional:**
- **UXD Folder** (from Stage 4)
- **RTSD Document** (from Stage 5)

## **OUTPUTS**

### **Validated FSD:**
- Complete functional requirements
- Validated user stories
- Confirmed acceptance criteria
- Identified implementation priorities

### **Analysis Report:**
- Requirements completeness score
- Gap analysis results
- Consistency validation
- Implementation readiness assessment

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

The FSD Analysis & Validation stage is successful when:
- âœ… All functional requirements are complete
- âœ… User stories have clear acceptance criteria
- âœ… Business logic is fully defined
- âœ… No gaps or inconsistencies found
- âœ… Implementation priorities are established
- âœ… Ready for Stage 6.2: Implementation Planning
